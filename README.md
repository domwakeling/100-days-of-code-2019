# 100 Days Of Code (2019) - Log

*Starting a new repo for 2019 so that changes will appear on my activity!*

## Day 1: January 27, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Working on the [freeCodeCamp](https://freeCodeCamp.org)
Data Visualisation section; ran through D3 lessons.

## Day 2: January 28, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Working on the [freeCodeCamp](https://freeCodeCamp.org)
Front End section; ran through React lessons.

## Day 3: January 29, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Started working through the introduction from Programming Python,
using Pythonista on iPad.

**Thoughts:** Surprised by how well Pythonista adapts - hadn't been sure that there would
be much file-system access (sure that it's sand-boxed, but even so works better than
I had expected).

## Day 4: January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Working on the [freeCodeCamp](https://freeCodeCamp.org)
Font End section; ran through Redux lessons, did three of the Rosetta Code challenges.

Continued working through Programming Python examples on Pythonista.

## Day 5: January 31, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Working on the [freeCodeCamp](https://freeCodeCamp.org)
Responsive Web Design challenges, finished the new Portfolio.

**Thoughts:** Have been putting this off because of the issues over images for the Pens that are completed, but think I've finally got an approach sorted <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>.

## Day 6: February 1, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Working on the [freeCodeCamp](https://freeCodeCamp.org)
Front End section; continued Redux.

## Day 7: February 2, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Working on the [freeCodeCamp](https://freeCodeCamp.org)
Front End section; finished Redux, worked through Redux/React.

Dived into the first Front End project, Quote Machine. Previously completed
this on the old syllabus, but started again and wrote in React. Used the same 
API, but used <code>fetch()</code> rather than <code>jQuery.ajax()</code>.

**Thoughts:** Had to work out how to use a readable stream from fetch to get
a JSON object, and work out how to convert character entities to Unicode
entities so that they would display properly in React.

## Day 8: February 3, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Worked on [freeCodeCamp](https://freeCodeCamp.org)
Markdown Previewer as part of the Front End certificate. Previously completed
this challenge under the old syllabus, but re-wrote from scratch. Used Redux
to store a common state and pass information between the two containers
(first time I've written something in Redux for myself).

**Thoughts:** Hit some problems with Redux, hadn't appreciated that (for
certain parts of Redux/React) you need to have written an element/method
before calling it. Had me stumped for half an hour whilst I worked through
issues, not helped because I was making mistakes in the Redux code since it 
was my first attempt!
